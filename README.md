## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
See [references](#references) for links to dashboard and API documentation.

### Prerequisite

- Ensure you have your test (and live) [API keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/api-keys).
```
Flutter version >= 1.17.0
Flutterwave version 3 API keys
```

 ### Installing
 
**Step 1.** Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

**Step 2.** Add the dependency

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

1. `flutterwave: 0.0.3-dev.2`
2. run `flutter pub get`

## Usage

### 1. Create a `Flutterwave` instance

Create a `Flutterwave` instance by calling the constructor `Flutterwave.forUIPayment()` The constructor accepts a mandatory instance of the following:
 the calling `Context` , `publicKey`, `encryptionKey`, `amount`, `currency`, `email`, `fullName`, `txRef`, `isDebugMode` and `phoneNumber` . It returns an instance of `Flutterwave`  which we then call the `async` method `.initializeForUiPayments()` on.

     beginPayment async () { 
       try { 
		     Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave.forUIPayment(
                         context: this.context,
                         encryptionKey: "FLWPUBK_TEST-SANDBOXDEMOKEY-X",
                         publicKey: "FLWPUBK_TEST-SANDBOXDEMOKEY-X",
                         currency: this.currency,
                         amount: this.amount,
                         email: "valid@email.com",
                         fullName: "Valid Full Name",
                         txRef: this.txref,
                         isDebugMode: true,
                         phoneNumber: "0123456789",
                         acceptCardPayment: true,
                         acceptUSSDPayment: false,
                         acceptAccountPayment: false,
                         acceptFrancophoneMobileMoney: false,
                         acceptGhanaPayment: false,
                         acceptMpesaPayment: false,
                         acceptRwandaMoneyPayment: true,
                         acceptUgandaPayment: false,
                         acceptZambiaPayment: false)
                         
             final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.initializeForUiPayments();
                        
	         } catch(error) {
		         handleError(error);
	         }



### 2. Handle the response

 Calling the `.initialiazeForUiPayments()` method returns a `Future`
 of `ChargeResponse` which we await for the actual response as seen above.
 
 An example of how to make payment in a Widget would look like this:
 
 ```
    class PaymentWidget extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      _PaymentWidgetState createState() => _PaymentWidgetState();
    }
    
    class _PaymentWidgetState extends State<PaymentWidget> {
      final String txref = "My_unique_transaction_reference_123";
      final String amount = "200";
      final String currency = FlutterwaveCurrency.RWF;
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Container();
      }
    
      beginPayment() async {
        final Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave.forUIPayment(
            context: this.context,
            encryptionKey: "FLWPUBK_TEST-SANDBOXDEMOKEY-X",
            publicKey: "FLWPUBK_TEST-SANDBOXDEMOKEY-X",
            currency: this.currency,
            amount: this.amount,
            email: "valid@email.com",
            fullName: "Valid Full Name",
            txRef: this.txref,
            isDebugMode: true,
            phoneNumber: "0123456789",
            acceptCardPayment: true,
            acceptUSSDPayment: false,
            acceptAccountPayment: false,
            acceptFrancophoneMobileMoney: false,
            acceptGhanaPayment: false,
            acceptMpesaPayment: false,
            acceptRwandaMoneyPayment: true,
            acceptUgandaPayment: false,
            acceptZambiaPayment: false);
    
        try {
          final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.initializeForUiPayments();
          if (response == null) {
            // user didn't complete the transaction.
          } else {
            final isSuccessful = checkPaymentIsSuccessful(response);
            if (isSuccessful) {
              // provide value to customer
            } else {
              // check message
              print(response.message);
    
              // check status
              print(response.status);
    
              // check processor error
              print(response.data.processorResponse);
            }
          }
        } catch (error, stacktrace) {
          // handleError(error);
        }
      }
    
      bool checkPaymentIsSuccessful(final ChargeResponse response) {
        return response.data.status == FlutterwaveConstants.SUCCESSFUL &&
            response.data.currency == this.currency &&
            response.data.amount == this.amount &&
            response.data.txRef == this.txref;
      }
    }
```
 
#### Please note that:
 - `ChargeResponse` can be null, depending on if the user cancels
   the transaction by pressing back.
 - You need to check the status of the transaction from the instance of `ChargeResponse` returned from calling `.initializeForUiPayments()`, the `amount`, `currency` and `txRef` are correct before providing value to the customer
 - To accept payment of different kinds, you need set the currency to the correspending payment type i.e, `KES` for `Mpesa`, `RWF` for `Rwanda Mobile Money`, `NGN` for `USSD`,
`Bank Accounts Payment` and so on.

>  **PLEASE NOTE**

> We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be sure everything checks out before providing service or goods as seen in the `checkPaymentIsSuccessful()` method above.
